# spark-ssr

**Zero config. No build. SSR the Spark way.**

The framework reads the HTML template and infers everything:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1>Tasks</h1>

<template await="todos">
  <input bind:value="draft" placeholder="New task">
  <button onclick={add}>Add</button>
  <template each="todo in todos">
    <li>
      <input type="checkbox" bind:checked="todo.done" onchange={patch}>
      {todo.title}
      <button onclick={remove}>✕</button>
    </li>
  </template>
</template>

<spark-ssr table="todos" live />
```

```bash
bun spark-ssr
```

That's it — the table is **created for you** (the template is the schema),
the REST API exists, the page is server-rendered and hydrated, and `live`
keeps every open tab in sync.

| The template says                               | The framework knows                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<template each="todo in todos">`               | You need data called `todos`                 |
| `table="todos"`                                 | It's backed by the `todos` table             |
| `{todo.title}` interpolation                    | `title` is a TEXT column                     |
| `bind:checked="todo.done"`                      | `done` is a boolean column                   |
| `onclick={add}` (outside the loop)              | `POST /api/todos` — insert                   |
| `bind:checked` + `onchange={patch}` (in loop)   | `PATCH /api/todos/:id` — update `done`       |
| `onclick={remove}` (inside the loop)            | `DELETE /api/todos/:id` — remove the row     |
| `bind:value="draft"`                            | Local state variable `draft`                 |
| `user_id` column in the table                   | Auth — `WHERE user_id = :session.id`         |
| `required maxlength="120"` on a form input      | The server validates the same rules          |

No `<script>`. No SQL. No ORM. No server file. No setup.js. No build step.

## Config (spark.json)

```json
{
  "db": "postgres://localhost:5432/myapp",
  "auth": { "table": "users", "identity": "email", "secret": "ENV.SESSION_SECRET" },
  "cors": true,
  "fonts": [{ "family": "Inter", "google": true, "weights": [400, 700] }]
}
```

`sqlite://./dev.db` works too (Bun ships both drivers). `ENV.*` values resolve
from the environment at startup. `cors: true` allows all origins on `/api/*`;
an array allows specific ones. `fonts` renders spark-html-font's head tags
(preloads, `@font-face` with a size-adjusted no-shift fallback, a
`--font-<slug>` var) into every page — same shapes as its build-pipeline step.

## Routing

The filesystem is the router. `pages/index.html` → `/`,
`pages/blog/[slug].html` → `/blog/:slug` (`:slug` binds into queries).
Without a `pages/` folder, `*.html` at the project root serve the same way.

## Layouts — folders own their chrome

`pages/_layout.html` wraps every page in the folder (nested folders nest
their layouts). A layout is a component; `<slot>` is the page:

```html
<!-- pages/_layout.html -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
<script type="module" src="/app.js"></script>
<div import="/components/nav" blog="{author.name}"></div>
<slot></slot>
<footer>© {author.name}</footer>

<spark-ssr>
  author = SELECT id, name, bio FROM users LIMIT 1
</spark-ssr>
```

The layout's `<spark-ssr>` vars are in scope for every page it wraps. Head
tags lift from layout AND page; the page wins on conflicts.

## Named data — the block says what it feeds

```html
<spark-ssr>
  posts  = SELECT * FROM posts WHERE published = 1 ORDER BY created_at DESC
  author = SELECT id, name, bio FROM users LIMIT 1
</spark-ssr>
```

`var = SELECT …` is page data with no endpoint exposed — what most pages
actually want. Write `GET /api/posts → posts = SELECT …` when you also want
a public endpoint. Name/singular/fallback matching still works for
`table="…"` blocks and unnamed routes — nothing breaks.

`:` params inject automatically: path params (`:slug`), query string (`:q`),
form/JSON body (`:body.title`), session (`:session.id`), headers
(`:header.x-forwarded-for`), uploads (`:file.url`).

## Sources beyond SQL — same block, more worlds

```html
<spark-ssr>
  repo    = https://api.github.com/repos/wilkinnovo/spark-html
  posts   = ./content/posts/*.md
  weather = ./lib/weather.js
</spark-ssr>
```

- **URL** — server-side fetch, JSON parsed; `:slug`-style params interpolate.
- **Glob** — files become rows: front-matter → columns, body → `.body`,
  filename → `.slug`. A blog with no database at all. (`{post.body}` renders
  text; markdown rendering is a companion package's job.)
- **Module** — default export `(req, db) => value`. The escape hatch gets a
  declarative front door.

## Status, redirect, and guard

```html
<!-- blog/[slug].html -->
<template if="post"> … </template>
<template else status="404"><h1>Not found</h1></template>

<!-- admin/index.html -->
<spark-ssr guard="session" redirect="/login" />
```

`status="…"` on a rendered branch sets the response status — crawlers stop
indexing a 200-that-means-404. `guard="expr"`: when falsy, `redirect="…"`
answers 303, `status="401"` sets the code, default 403. An `is_admin` (or
`role`) column on the auth table rides into the session, so
`guard="session.is_admin"` works — and admins read scoped tables unscoped.

## Forms without JavaScript

The auto-CRUD endpoints answer a browser like a browser:

```html
<form action="/api/posts" method="post" redirect="/admin">
  <input name="title" required maxlength="120">
  <textarea name="body"></textarea>
  <button>Save draft</button>
</form>
```

A plain form post that succeeds 303s back to the referrer (or the form's
`redirect="…"`); the page re-renders with fresh data. **The app works with
JavaScript disabled.** Login and logout are forms too:

```html
<form action="/api/users?auth" method="post">
  <input type="email" name="email" required>
  <input type="password" name="password" required>
  <button>Sign in</button>
</form>
<form action="/api/logout" method="post"><button>Sign out</button></form>
```

### The form is the validator

`required`, `maxlength`, `min`/`max`, `type="email"`, `pattern` — the
constraint attributes you already wrote for the browser run again on the
server before the matching auto-CRUD write. Violations answer `422` with
`{ errors: { title: "…" } }` (JSON) or re-render the page with `{errors.title}`
and `{values.title}` in scope (form post).

## The template is the schema

```bash
bun spark-ssr db        # show inferred schema vs live DB (a diff)
bun spark-ssr db push   # create/alter tables to match the templates
```

Column inference: `{todo.title}` → TEXT, `bind:checked` → boolean,
`type="number"` inputs → numeric, `id`/`created_at` always, `user_id` when
auth is configured and the page reads the session. Seed rows sharpen types:

```html
<spark-ssr table="todos" seed="./seed/todos.json" live />
```

Seeds apply once, idempotently (only into an empty table; auth-table
passwords hash on the way in). `serve` runs the safe half automatically —
missing tables are created and seeds applied at startup, so a fresh clone
runs on `bun spark-ssr` alone. Columns are never dropped without
`db push --force`. Seed files are never served as static assets.

## `live` — HTML that reacts across the wire

```html
<spark-ssr table="todos" live />
```

Every write through the server pings `/__spark/live` (SSE) with the table
name; hydrated pages refetch through their own session — every open tab
updates, scoping intact. No socket code, no pub/sub. spark-html-websocket
stays for custom protocols; `live` is the zero-config 90%.

## Lists — `?page`, `?sort`, `?q`

```html
<spark-ssr table="recipes" limit="20" search="title,ingredients" />
```

- `?page=2` → `LIMIT/OFFSET`, plus `{recipes.total}` and `{recipes.pages}`.
- `?sort=created_at:desc` → validated against real columns, then `ORDER BY`.
- `?q=…` → `LIKE` across the block's `search="…"` columns.

`cache="60"` on any block adds a per-source TTL, invalidated automatically
when a table it reads from changes.

## Dev tools

- **Error overlay** — a failing query or throwing page script puts the real
  error (message, stack) on the page instead of a bare 500.
- **Unresolved-var banner** — "this page reads `{posts}` but no source
  provides it — nearest source: `published`". The silent-blank bug becomes
  a sentence.
- **`/__spark/plan`** — every route, table, endpoint, and each page's
  var → source bindings. "View source" for the inferred backend.
- **Live reload** — every edit (pages, layouts, components, queries,
  middleware, css, markdown) refreshes the browser via SSE.

All dev-only; `start` and compiled builds ship none of it.

## The page owns its \<head\> — and SEO comes free

Literal `<title>`/`<meta>`/`<link>` tags at the top of a page lift into the
document head, `{expr}`-interpolated against the page's data
(spark-html-head's `/ssr` module does the lifting):

```html
<title>{post.title} · My Blog</title>
<meta name="description" content="{post.excerpt}">
```

`og:title`/`og:description` derive from those unless overridden.
`/sitemap.xml` is generated from the pages — `[param]` routes enumerate
their bound query. `/robots.txt` honors `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
and guards. Author your own files in `public/` to override any of it.

## Client scripts and the family

A page's plain `<script>` runs on the **server** (the escape hatch).
`<script type="module">` and `<script src>` are **client** scripts — they lift
into `<head>` after an auto-generated importmap, so bare imports of the Spark
family just work, no build:

```js
// public/app.js
import { theme } from 'spark-html-theme';
theme();
```

Every `spark-html-*` package in your dependencies is importmap-mapped and
served at `/@modules/<name>/…`. Depend on **spark-html-theme** and the
no-flash init snippet is inlined in every head automatically; depend on
**spark-html-image** and `spark-ssr build` runs its webp/srcset pass over
`dist/` — and uploads get a webp variant at write time (`:file.url` points
at it; `:file.original` keeps the source file).

## Custom endpoints — api/

`api/stats.html` auto-serves as `GET /api/stats`:

```html
<spark-ssr>
  GET → SELECT COUNT(*) AS videos FROM videos
</spark-ssr>
```

Or drop to a `<script>` (runs server-side; `req`, `res`, `db`, `fetch` in
scope; the return value becomes the JSON response).

## Everything else

- **Components** — `<div import="/components/card" title="{post.title}">`
  inlines at render time; components are pure UI.
- **Auth** — built-in email/password sessions (`POST /api/users?auth` logs in,
  passwords hash on insert), or a plugin (`auth.plugin` in spark.json) for
  OAuth/magic-link flows — the plugin answers "who is this person?", the
  framework still does sessions and cookies.
- **Middleware** — `middleware.html` runs on every request (`req`, `res`,
  `rateLimit`, `state` in scope; return `{ status, body }` to short-circuit).
- **Uploads** — multipart bodies stream to `uploads/`; `:file.url` binds the
  stored URL into your INSERT.
- **Error pages** — `404.html` / `500.html` (any `<status>.html`) at the
  project root.
- **Static assets** — `public/` plus co-located page assets, served as-is.
  Project internals (spark.json, package.json, `*.db`, seeds, dotfiles) are
  never served.
- **Hydration** — interactive pages ship fully-rendered HTML plus a generated
  client component; `mount()` takes over with the same spark-html runtime.
- **Auth-table hygiene** — the auth table's auto CRUD never returns password
  hashes, and PATCH/DELETE are own-account only. Configuring `auth` registers
  the table (login/signup endpoints) without any page declaring it; disable
  public signup in `middleware.html` if the app is invite-only.
